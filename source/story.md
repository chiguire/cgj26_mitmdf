At the strike of midnight, the New Year's Eve Masked Ball was interrupted by
a callous murder right in the middle of the dancefloor. {{PRESIDENT_NAME}}, the president of
the Magic Society and organiser of the NYE Masked Ball fell down to the floor,
lifeless, while the rest of the dancing group were celebrating the fireworks
that were exploding right above them in the ceiling.

It was a few seconds later when the horror was quite apparent. The president's
body lied on the floor and {{PRESIDENT_PRONOUN}} current dancing partner
screamed uncontrollably as they were realising what had just happened.

You are a detective called on emergency to figure out who killed the president.

In this ball, everyone dances standing in a checkered floor, one person per
tile. Every 5 seconds, the partners switch tiles with a random partner. The
room has some memory and will let you know some things that happened in the
previous 30 seconds to the murder.

You can also interview 6 suspects, among which the killer is one for sure. The
killer will attempt to lie and misguide you, the rest do not have reason to lie.

You can consult the magician's cheat sheet to figure out facts that you might
need to know in order to solve the case.

Good luck!

Magician's Guide to Murder
==========================

The most common ways magicians murder people are:

1) Killing spell: an elegant way to murder. The spellcaster must move one of
their hands. From a closed fist they open their hand finger by finger slowly
starting from the index, keeping the pinky curled; then they softly twist their
hand. While doing this they recite some words in silence while looking at the
victim. 15 seconds later, the victim will drop dead instantly, like a ragdoll.
You can tell a killing spell was used because the victim's pupils are dilated.

2) Poison thorn: magicians usually wear flowers with thorns in important
occasions. This makes a flower with a poisonous thorn a perfect weapon. The
murderer must be standing next to the victim when they apply the thorn to
any part of the body. The thorn does not become poisonous until it is applied
to the victim. 15 seconds later, the victim starts coughing and then suddenly
falls down. The thorn is dissolved at the moment, leaving no trace of it. The
victims eyes look reddened.

3) Hex patch: risky and gruesome, magicians tend not to use it. The murderer
needs to apply the patch to the victim, and the patch acts only after 5 seconds.
The murderer hands are usually a bit red after handling this patch. The patch
dissolves, leaving no trace of it. The victim's nails look blue-ish after the
patch does its effect.
